There is definitely room for improvement with how sparse and empty the rewards are for players that have already completed the currently available story, and the shallowness that is the gacha with the abysmal rates with characters and weapons being in separate banners to maximize profits over providing the player with options to avoid the fear of missing out.

"Game was amazing at first, but it seems like the company running the game now is completely different from the one at launch. There was more communication, character kit issues were actually resolved (instead of just being identified), and the character playstyles were straight forward and more or less well-designed. Now, bugs with characters are identified but are unresolved, the player base communication is practically non-existent when it comes to addressing concerns, and more often than not, the latest characters being released are nowhere near well-designed nor as powerful as the characters before (e.g. Kokomi being barely more useful than a free 4-star character, and Raiden being incompatible with characters of her own element, despite her kit being designed to be synergistic with them) Its obvious that the leadership strategy now is just to focus on milking the reputation they garnered at launch until people stop spending.

"genshin impact is a game with plenty of story and world exploration, but there is one issue I have noticed with the characters. there is a severe lack of diversity and the characters that are based off of certain cultures, such as the characters from sumeru and natlan, are misrepresented. they lack proper cultural representation and skin tone variation, despite being based off of vibrant cultures and peoples with darker skin tones. as a fan since day one, it's incredibly disappointing",impact plenty world exploration one issue noticed severe lack diversity based certain cultures sumeru natlan misrepresented lack proper cultural representation skin tone variation despite based vibrant cultures peoples darker skin tones fan since day one incredibly disappointing,1,1

"This game definitely seems to have started as a passion project and, at least through the early stages, is an impressive undertaking. But I don't really have high hopes for it going forward. While the art and music teams are still 100% on point, all other aspects of the game feel as though they've been left with a skeleton crew. Character balance has gone out the window, the writing quality has plummeted, the new parts of the world feel emptier and unfinished, unfixed bugs and frustrations abound. Some characters have had fundamental parts of their abilities bugged into non-functionality for *months*! It really does bring to mind abandoned early access Steam games with developers that sadly bite off more than they can chew - but with MiHoYo's success, they really should be able to do better. Adding to this sense of abandonment is MiHoYo's complete silence on all these matters. Every now and then they've put out a pithy tweet or a clever joke, but actual communication is essentially nonexistent. The community worldwide is just kinda left spinning their wheels wondering if anything is even being looked at regarding the issues we're all having. We all want to understand! We want to give them the benefit of the doubt! We'd love it if they told us they were having trouble, or that some major refactoring was necessary, or something like that. But... there's nothing at all from them. It really feels as though the community just straight-up doesn't exist to whoever's in charge of PR. Anyway, yeah.

"Genshin is probably the most beautiful game you can play at the moment, the univers is simply stunning, the animations are great though I wish they could be skipped after they've been seen once, like old school RPGs (this is one of the points where Mihoyo fails to draw from its predecesors). The characters are generally well thought out and fun to discover. Where things get hard is once you actually play the game: the controls are absolutely horrible and controller support is nowhere in sight (iOS has had this for nearly a year now but some of the workarounds people have come up with on Android have led to users being banned leaving you to contend with very underwhelming touchscreen controls). You will also find yourself fighting the engine much more than the enemies, there are a number of ways the game becomes anti-immersive, from the constant zooming-in depending on your combat actions (there should simply be a way to turn off auto zoom off but this illudes the devs completely) to enemies walking off a preset area mid-fight where they will walk back to their spawn point and regen 100% HP and have you start the fight over (something to drive you insane when fighting new and more powerfull foes). All in all the game is good but some basic improvements would make it much more enjoyable.",probably beautiful moment univers simply stunning animations though wish could skipped seen old school rpgs one points mihoyo fails draw predecesors generally well thought discover things get hard actually controls absolutely horrible controller support nowhere sight ios nearly year workarounds people come android led users banned leaving contend underwhelming touchscreen controls also find fighting engine enemies number ways becomes anti immersive constant zooming depending combat actions simply way turn auto zoom illudes devs completely enemies walking preset area mid fight walk back spawn point regen hp start fight something drive insane fighting new powerfull foes basic improvements would enjoyable,3,1

Genshin started strong in 2020 but in 2024 it has started to lose its appeal as a live service game: 1.) Lack of response from the developers in implementing Quality of Life changes that the community wants. 2.) Lack of proper endgame that would give purpose to the journey of collecting characters and building them up to become stronger in combat.

"I originally had a five star review, and I still love Genshin Impact. The problem, while a bit too in depth to effectively explain here, is in consensus; the lack of willingness to have a diverse cast of playable characters, and the dirt rewards.. especially compared to Honkai Star Rail. There's a lot of design opportunities for these beautiful characters, and it just hurts me that Hoyoverse is limiting themselves so much.",originally five star review impact problem bit depth effectively explain consensus lack willingness diverse cast playable dirt rewards especially compared honkai star rail design opportunities beautiful hurts hoyoverse limiting,3,1

"Game starts as rather fun. But the longer you play the more design and gameplay flaws you encounter. Overall experience can be summarized as following: Pros: 1. Fun to explore world with various puzzles; 2. Decent story; 3. Regular various events. Note: due to the big differences in event gameplay mechanics some may be to your liking and some may not, but considering overall variety it will still be a positive thing; 4. Smooth combat (albeit lacking some necessary UI elements). Cons: 1. Daily routine becomes too repetitive and boring after finishing world exploration; 2. Character progression is horrible with excessive RNG elements where it shouldn't be in the first place (looking at you artifact domains); 3. Developers feedback is lacking and issues that have been bothering players since day 1 are still unaddressed. Conclusion: Overall it may be ok to try this game for a bit - just don't expect much in the long term.",starts rather longer design gameplay flaws encounter overall experience summarized following pros explore world various puzzles decent regular various events note due big differences event gameplay mechanics may liking may considering overall variety positive thing smooth combat albeit lacking necessary ui elements cons daily routine becomes repetitive boring finishing world exploration progression horrible excessive rng elements first place looking artifact domains developers feedback lacking issues bothering players since day unaddressed conclusion overall may ok try bit expect long term,3,1

The game grips you with a beautiful visual from the start and tried to keep you there with a nice story and a host of interesting characters.

"TLDR; PRO: Exploring A+, fun combat mechanics, enjoyable even for F2P casuals. CONS: Lag/heat/other issues on mobile, resin, security. LONG REVIEW: What I enjoy the most of the game is exploring the open world. You can climb on EVERY vertical structure. As a person who always try to climb things in-game, this is 10/10 (although the ease to climb EVERYTHING does bite you back when in combat near trees or fences). Puzzles are not too difficult for an average person. Battle mechanic (elemental reaction) is really fun to execute as well. Enemies are quite lovable since they have their own quirks. For example: sleeping and snoring at their camps, dancing around bonfire, the ice mage jumping and mocking when you get frozen (GRR). Additionally, it is possible to play without spending your money for gacha. You can obtain currency (primogems) for your roll by doing things in-game (but ofc it will involve some grinding). THE CONS however, mostly come from mobile platform pov. 1) It's difficult to play in mid/low ranged phone due to lag and heat issues even on lowest setting. God forbid if battle takes place at a field with burnable grass. Everything starts lagging. 1.1) Because of the lag, using archer character is near impossible in mobile. I can't move the reticle in aiming mode during combat or challenges. Sometimes it can move, but only 2-3 pixels. 2) The camera rotation is horrible. I would like to see the enemies while attacking. Instead, I get the grass covering my entire screen or have the camera pan towards my character instead the enemies. 3) The on-screen action button, particularly sprint and jump are too close I feel like. Very often I accidentally tap jump instead of sprint during battle. That's all for the issues on mobile port. However, 4) Resin requirement should be less (10 instead of 20 for example) or change the replenish time to be quicker. 5) The price for gem purchase is ridiculous! Trust me, I've played games with gacha system for the past 10 years. The price is expensive with the very low rates. 6) Account security is... very weak (Look it up). If it's not for this I would have give the game 4/5.",tldr pro exploring combat mechanics enjoyable f p casuals cons lag heat issues mobile resin security long review enjoy exploring open world climb every vertical structure person always try climb things although ease climb everything bite back combat near trees fences puzzles difficult average person battle mechanic elemental reaction execute well enemies quite lovable since quirks example sleeping snoring camps dancing around bonfire ice mage jumping mocking get frozen grr additionally possible without spending money gacha obtain currency primogems roll things ofc involve grinding cons however mostly come mobile platform pov difficult mid low ranged phone due lag heat issues lowest setting god forbid battle takes place field burnable grass everything starts lagging lag using archer near impossible mobile move reticle aiming mode combat challenges sometimes move pixels camera rotation horrible would see enemies attacking instead get grass covering entire screen camera pan towards instead enemies screen action button particularly sprint jump close often accidentally tap jump instead sprint battle issues mobile port however resin requirement less instead example change replenish time quicker price gem purchase ridiculous trust games gacha system past years price expensive low rates account security weak look would give,3,1

Challenge content rewards some premium currency, but often requires premium teams to earn the full amount.

"So I would like to state first off that this game has amazing potential as the game itself is great albeit with a large amount of glaring issues in its current state. Pros - *Great Story w/Good Writing. A lot of the characters are fun to listen to, even if they aren't one of the main characters. *Excellent Character and World Design. I could often just get lost in the world and have fun just wandering around. *Bosses with mechanics that are fun to figure out. Once they are figured out, they are still fun to fight on repeat for rewards. *Diverse ability sets in characters where even less powerful ones are fun to play as still. *Very clean user interface. *Large inventory size to fit with the fact that you will be getting a LOT of loot A fair amount of ways to get premium currency while remaining f2p. Cons - *After a certain point the story just stops, and it is very easy to get to that point before realizing it. Worse it stops on a cliffhanger in the story (Current game has all of the acts of the Prologue but only 2 out of the 3 acts in Chapter 1). *While playing the early game I was incentivized to use the gacha mechanic, even spent 15$ on it, but after a certain point getting new characters just means you have to slog to level them up to the currently level of your party which involves not using said new character. And when I say slog, I mean it. The further you get in the game, the harder it is to level up any character period. *The main co-op content/material farming systems are locked behind the 'Resin' system. Item/Exp/Material farms cost 20 Resin, Bosses Cost 40, and Mega Bosses cost 60. You have a maximum of 120 Resin, only replenish-able by scarce in game items or premium currency. The main problem with this is that these portions are the only things to do after completing the current stopping point in the main story, leaving typically around an hours worth of time to play each day without spending money. While at this point right now I am done with the main story and all of the side quests, not counting 3 more that I'd have to grind days in order to achieve access to them, and I had my fun. Unfortunately there is no real reason for me to continue playing more than to just claim daily rewards for now. Still got a good 30-40ish hours out of it and I hope more improves sooner rather than later. 2.7/5 Stars, but pending to change as the game updates.

"I'm very disappointed. I keep seeing ads and YouTubers and even my friends talking about how fun this game is and I've been wanting to play it for years, but the game takes way too much storage! and it's ridiculous that I can't even download it on a factory reset tablet or my computer! Warframe easily has double the content if not more, and takes way way way less storage to download, even with all the updates! if Warframe can do it, what's this game's excuse?",disappointed keep seeing ads youtubers friends talking wanting years takes way storage ridiculous download factory reset tablet computer warframe easily double content takes way way way less storage download updates warframe excuse,1,1

"Cool Zelda like RPG which used to be ok for phones when it took less than 10GB space. (As of 2023 you need +26GB free storage space to start the game...) 2020: Old phone (doesn't meet the min spec reqs recommended) couldn't keep up with the cutscenes always and the game was lagging even with good ping/lowest graphs at times. A few times I also got that loud cracking sound. Still bearable enough that I'm Adv20+. Glad that ""old"" phone still works for this. Love the lack of ads even with FTP.",cool zelda rpg used ok phones took less gb space gb free storage space start old phone meet min spec reqs recommended keep cutscenes always lagging ping lowest graphs times times also got loud cracking sound bearable enough adv glad old phone works lack ads ftp,4,0
"I really like this game, but today I tried to play it, and it keeps throwing me out.

Can you please fix it?",today tried keeps throwing phone sent notification open bug try developers fixed update please fix,4,0
"Too big. This game and its updates take up too much space for a non-dedicated device. Need to be able to install to SD card. Need to be able to use external controller. I have full size adult hands, so on-screen controls don't work if I want to see the screen. The game itself is very good, but I'll be waiting for the Switch release for mobile play. Do not recommend for mobile.",big updates space non dedicated device able install sd card able use external controller full size adult hands screen controls work see screen waiting switch release mobile recommend mobile,3,1
"Ive poured alot of heart and soul into this game, even money and time. So its extremely disapointing to see a game that is taking insparation from other cultures and not useing any diverse skintones. Hoyo has shown that they are capable with diversity with the enemys. But thats the problem, its only the enemies. The amount of colorism and racsim within the game to make none of the playable characters frome a nation inspired by beautiful diversity is sickening. Do better.",i ve poured alot heart soul money time extremely disapointing see taking insparation cultures useing diverse skintones hoyo shown capable diversity enemys that s problem enemies amount colorism racsim within none playable frome nation inspired beautiful diversity sickening better,1,1
