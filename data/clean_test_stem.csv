There is definitely room for improvement with how sparse and empty the rewards are for players that have already completed the currently available story, and the shallowness that is the gacha with the abysmal rates with characters and weapons being in separate banners to maximize profits over providing the player with options to avoid the fear of missing out.

This game runs terribly on my HTC 10. There should be a hardware check or some form of benchmark before letting you decide if you want to perform the 6GB download or not. The intro could barely play freezing most of the time and the game looks blurry. Otherwise from what I've managed to play it looks promising. Not a fan of onscreen keypads but the controls are pretty well designed making picking up items and controlling the camera easy.

"Game was amazing at first, but it seems like the company running the game now is completely different from the one at launch. There was more communication, character kit issues were actually resolved (instead of just being identified), and the character playstyles were straight forward and more or less well-designed. Now, bugs with characters are identified but are unresolved, the player base communication is practically non-existent when it comes to addressing concerns, and more often than not, the latest characters being released are nowhere near well-designed nor as powerful as the characters before (e.g. Kokomi being barely more useful than a free 4-star character, and Raiden being incompatible with characters of her own element, despite her kit being designed to be synergistic with them) Its obvious that the leadership strategy now is just to focus on milking the reputation they garnered at launch until people stop spending. And maybe, hopefully, only after all the goodwill has faded away, will the leadership finally start giving the playerbase the appreciation they deserve, if any of us are still around. I know I won't be.",amaz first seem compani run complet differ one launch commun kit issu actual resolv instead identifi playstyl straight forward less well design bug identifi unresolv base commun practic non exist come address concern often latest releas nowher near well design power e g kokomi bare use free star raiden incompat element despit kit design synergist obviou leadership strategi focu milk reput garner launch peopl stop spend mayb hope goodwil fade away leadership final start give playerbas appreci deserv us around know,2,1

It really does bring to mind abandoned early access Steam games with developers that sadly bite off more than they can chew - but with MiHoYo's success, they really should be able to do better. Adding to this sense of abandonment is MiHoYo's complete silence on all these matters. Every now and then they've put out a pithy tweet or a clever joke, but actual communication is essentially nonexistent. The community worldwide is just kinda left spinning their wheels wondering if anything is even being looked at regarding the issues we're all having. We all want to understand!

The characters are generally well thought out and fun to discover. Where things get hard is once you actually play the game: the controls are absolutely horrible and controller support is nowhere in sight (iOS has had this for nearly a year now but some of the workarounds people have come up with on Android have led to users being banned leaving you to contend with very underwhelming touchscreen controls). You will also find yourself fighting the engine much more than the enemies, there are a number of ways the game becomes anti-immersive, from the constant zooming-in depending on your combat actions (there should simply be a way to turn off auto zoom off but this illudes the devs completely) to enemies walking off a preset area mid-fight where they will walk back to their spawn point and regen 100% HP and have you start the fight over (something to drive you insane when fighting new and more powerfull foes).

Lack of response from the developers in implementing Quality of Life changes that the community wants. 2.)

The game is also hindered by poor alternatives such as TCG and combat events that force you to only use trial characters.

Smooth combat (albeit lacking some necessary UI elements). Cons: 1. Daily routine becomes too repetitive and boring after finishing world exploration; 2. Character progression is horrible with excessive RNG elements where it shouldn't be in the first place (looking at you artifact domains); 3.

"TLDR; PRO: Exploring A+, fun combat mechanics, enjoyable even for F2P casuals. CONS: Lag/heat/other issues on mobile, resin, security. LONG REVIEW: What I enjoy the most of the game is exploring the open world. You can climb on EVERY vertical structure. As a person who always try to climb things in-game, this is 10/10 (although the ease to climb EVERYTHING does bite you back when in combat near trees or fences). Puzzles are not too difficult for an average person. Battle mechanic (elemental reaction) is really fun to execute as well. Enemies are quite lovable since they have their own quirks. For example: sleeping and snoring at their camps, dancing around bonfire, the ice mage jumping and mocking when you get frozen (GRR). Additionally, it is possible to play without spending your money for gacha. You can obtain currency (primogems) for your roll by doing things in-game (but ofc it will involve some grinding). THE CONS however, mostly come from mobile platform pov. 1) It's difficult to play in mid/low ranged phone due to lag and heat issues even on lowest setting. God forbid if battle takes place at a field with burnable grass. Everything starts lagging. 1.1) Because of the lag, using archer character is near impossible in mobile. I can't move the reticle in aiming mode during combat or challenges. Sometimes it can move, but only 2-3 pixels. 2) The camera rotation is horrible. I would like to see the enemies while attacking. Instead, I get the grass covering my entire screen or have the camera pan towards my character instead the enemies. 3) The on-screen action button, particularly sprint and jump are too close I feel like. Very often I accidentally tap jump instead of sprint during battle. That's all for the issues on mobile port. However, 4) Resin requirement should be less (10 instead of 20 for example) or change the replenish time to be quicker. 5) The price for gem purchase is ridiculous! Trust me, I've played games with gacha system for the past 10 years. The price is expensive with the very low rates. 6) Account security is... very weak (Look it up). If it's not for this I would have give the game 4/5.",tldr pro explor combat mechan enjoy f p casual con lag heat issu mobil resin secur long review enjoy explor open world climb everi vertic structur person alway tri climb thing although eas climb everyth bite back combat near tree fenc puzzl difficult averag person battl mechan element reaction execut well enemi quit lovabl sinc quirk exampl sleep snore camp danc around bonfir ice mage jump mock get frozen grr addit possibl without spend money gacha obtain currenc primogem roll thing ofc involv grind con howev mostli come mobil platform pov difficult mid low rang phone due lag heat issu lowest set god forbid battl take place field burnabl grass everyth start lag lag use archer near imposs mobil move reticl aim mode combat challeng sometim move pixel camera rotat horribl would see enemi attack instead get grass cover entir screen camera pan toward instead enemi screen action button particularli sprint jump close often accident tap jump instead sprint battl issu mobil port howev resin requir less instead exampl chang replenish time quicker price gem purchas ridicul trust game gacha system past year price expens low rate account secur weak look would give,3,1

"So I would like to state first off that this game has amazing potential as the game itself is great albeit with a large amount of glaring issues in its current state. Pros - *Great Story w/Good Writing. A lot of the characters are fun to listen to, even if they aren't one of the main characters. *Excellent Character and World Design. I could often just get lost in the world and have fun just wandering around. *Bosses with mechanics that are fun to figure out. Once they are figured out, they are still fun to fight on repeat for rewards. *Diverse ability sets in characters where even less powerful ones are fun to play as still. *Very clean user interface. *Large inventory size to fit with the fact that you will be getting a LOT of loot A fair amount of ways to get premium currency while remaining f2p. Cons - *After a certain point the story just stops, and it is very easy to get to that point before realizing it. Worse it stops on a cliffhanger in the story (Current game has all of the acts of the Prologue but only 2 out of the 3 acts in Chapter 1). *While playing the early game I was incentivized to use the gacha mechanic, even spent 15$ on it, but after a certain point getting new characters just means you have to slog to level them up to the currently level of your party which involves not using said new character. And when I say slog, I mean it. The further you get in the game, the harder it is to level up any character period. *The main co-op content/material farming systems are locked behind the 'Resin' system. Item/Exp/Material farms cost 20 Resin, Bosses Cost 40, and Mega Bosses cost 60. You have a maximum of 120 Resin, only replenish-able by scarce in game items or premium currency. The main problem with this is that these portions are the only things to do after completing the current stopping point in the main story, leaving typically around an hours worth of time to play each day without spending money. While at this point right now I am done with the main story and all of the side quests, not counting 3 more that I'd have to grind days in order to achieve access to them, and I had my fun. Unfortunately there is no real reason for me to continue playing more than to just claim daily rewards for now. Still got a good 30-40ish hours out of it and I hope more improves sooner rather than later. 2.7/5 Stars, but pending to change as the game updates.
