Some might argue that this is false because there's so many nations/locations; before I would've agreed but after playing this game for more than a year, I disagree. My reasoning for it is because exploring Teyvat isn't that hard. Teyvat is very easy to explore + the map is also really easy to understand which makes exploring really easy. Other than that, the characters are all designed well.

Also needed for more fun exploring the world space would be variable walking and running speed. (For an example of high tier movement check mobile game Sky).

There is little significance to exploration, because you don't need most of the things in the field. Food isn't necessary to progress in the game. Enhancing gear just feels like an annoying obstacle that you have to get through just so you can keep progressing. And, perhaps the most irritating thing is how clunky the transitions from activity such as swimming, climbing, etc. are to going back to walking/combat, especially during timed challenges. In fact, it's almost like the climbing time challenges are showcasing how terrible the game is at guessing when the player wants to climb up and when the player doesn't want to climb up. It's irritating during normal exploration as well since you'll randomly climb up trees for no reason. Not to mention, gacha rates are abysmal.

It's a fun game don't get me wrong but it's just not that great to play mobile wise. The archery is a chore and a half to aim with unless you have 3rd party tools. Events aren't that fun to do. The characters look nice and the gacha seems okay but it's just not all that enticing to play unless you have a console or PC. The combat has some depth but it could use at least an extra combo or 2 to spice it from just being 1 standard combo.

"|| POSITIVES || TEYVAT is a beautiful world, with breathtaking vistas and secrets to be discovered, full of hidden lore. The different countries are distinct and offer some variety of enemies. THE SOUNDTRACK is, hands down, one of the best in gaming history. From epic orchestral arrangements to electric guitar to soft piano melodies, it has it all and they're incredibly well mixed together. PLAYABLE CHARACTERS are very aesthetically pleasing, well voice acted and unique. THE MAIN STORY has some slow moments but overall I think it's good and has some EPIC battles scattered about. COMBAT in this game is great, imo. It's fluid, flashy and satisfying. Newer characters have overall better and more diverse animations than the older ones, but that's to be expected. THE HOUSING SYSTEM is a good sandbox addition to the game, though I can see how it's not for everyone. It's been updated fairly regularly since its release, with a big update coming in 2.2. GAME UPDATES every 6 weeks (on the dot!) with new events, and most times adds new characters or areas to explore. || NEGATIVES || It's a GACHA. And one with TERRIBLE rates. If you plan to go free to play don't expect to have most 5-stars in the game. On the other hand, 4-star characters are VERY good (for the most part) and nothing in this game requires you to have the best 5-star characters. THE WEAPON BANNER is a complete travesty, so only pull on it if you're a whale or if you like both featured weapons. THE ""ENDGAME"" is very grindy and repetitive, resin (energy) is scarce and if you're done with events you'll finish up your daily stuffs in about 15-20 minutes. BUGS and flawed mechanics/characters that have not been fixed since release. I rarely play on my phone, but every time I tried it's been a miserable experience. Do yourself a favor and try to play on PC, even a laptop with a integrated GPU does a better job running this game than my flagship smartphone. Also, the controls on mobile are terrible in my opinion. But hey, if you're used to it and you have a gaming smartphone I guess you can judge for yourself. || RECENT CONTROVERSIES || This game has been review bombed twice now, and it's for a simple reason: Mihoyo's communication with the player base is ATROCIOUS. They refuse to address glaring issues with the game, two of the last four 5-star characters have been released with broken mechanics or simply in a bad state, the anniversary rewards were, in my opinion, strangely bad for such a huge game and, to all these problems, their answer has been the same for the last 4 months: silence.

In addition to this since there are very little new quests there are about 30 minutes of content every day. The resin system is also very discouraging since you can only do a limited number of domains (and don't get me started on the drops). The game could be easily improved.,start keep progress gradual less less late limit way get primogem buy addit sinc littl new quest minut content everi day resin system also discourag sinc limit number domain get start drop could easili improv,2,1

"As great as Genshin Impact is for a Free-to-Play game with huge amount of fun and interesting events and contents always being added in each update, it has its own flaws that can't be overlooked unless you're worshiper of Mihoyo. In terms of graphics and worldbuilding of the game, it's a high quality product that works well even in mobile platform, especially considering the fact it's very large and eats a lot of storage and yet looks very beautiful. Its gameplay isn't too complexed to understand, yet enough for players and theory-crafters to come up with all kinds of different teams and match-up, and story that's praised by many fans of the game. Yet, it's fundamentally flaw as a game itself. In order for players to gain progress, it is outrageously slow because the resin, or stamina, charges up at an extremely slow rate, and the layers of RNG for artifacts (items to boost characters' stats) is ridiculous most of the times. To put into perspective, it can take several weeks or even months to get a worthwhile artifacts, and can be very tedious and grindy, making players like me feel burn out playing it. This artificial obstacle to keep players engaged to the game makes the game to become stale and uninteresting until the change comes. The lack of endgame contents also mean players don't have anything to spend their time to be entertained besides grinding same dungeon over and over again. Some may argue the wishing system or the gacha itself is predatory, but I believe it's at the right spot because it forces you to plan ahead of who you wish to get. Don't expect to get anyone if you don't bother to support the game, and the game itself isn't pay to win anyway, so there's no real competition among others.

My main issue is the devs will give their other games better QoL that this game definitely needs as probably their biggest player base. They don't seem to care much for global players and the biggest insult for me definitely has to be their unskippable 20 minute cutscenes with abysmal writing that I do not care for but am forced to sit through.

Only did the 5 star event because they knew their whole fan base was angry. I rlly liked this game at one point and I missed when genshin actually respected its audience.

"Genshin Impact has surprised me. I'm very critical of mobile games and the business practices associated with them, and while Genshin Impact isn't perfect, it's the best mobile game I've seen by far. When I initially saw Genshin Impact, my major concerns were: Business model, paywalls, overall gameplay and how they handled the quite obvious inspiration from The Legends of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Starting off with the business model. It's a gacha game, which is already a fair bit of a negative, I will never not speak out about psuedo-gambling mechanics and business models as they're inherently exploitative. Genshin's business model is... Okay for a gacha game. my biggest problem with it is that there are weapons in the gacha, where most players would prefer more of a focus of characters, putting weapons in feels like filler, and there are weapons only available from the gachas, separate from those which drop throughout the world. Now, onto paywalls. I've completed the story by now, and have not encountered any real paywalls. All progression is tied to ingame activities. Some materials however are in dungeons where you need a regenerating resource to open the final chest, and this resource has a rather low upper roof, and doesn't regenerate very quickly. The maximum amount being 120, refilling from 0 in 16 hours and I've encountered chests that cost 60 to open and this resource, can be refilled with premium currency. And then there's the gameplay, where this game actually shines! The game is a 3D action RPG, with a gorgeous artstyle that, while clearly inspired by Breath of the Wild is visually unique. Combat is fluid and fast, with every character having a weapon type and two abilities belonging to an element, and the combat system is a pretty good hack and slash affair at its base, with a dodge move to support it. Beyond the weapon combat there is an element combination system, where you swap between characters mid-fight and use the environment for new effects, in the rain, ice characters will freeze them solid, and electric attacks will cause them to chain lightning between each other, you can set fire to them and then electrocute them triggering an explosion and more! The game setting is a huge open world with plenty of secrets, collectibles and challenges all over the place, it's quite busy! My one BIG complaint here is that the game limits where you can explore pretty harshly right at the start, tying you down to a small part of the first area. What makes this extra puzzling is that the world is very obviously set up to be explored, just like Breath of the Wild, but unlike BOTW which opens up to a larger world very quickly, and tutorialises by showing instead of telling. Genshin Impact starts by pretty much railroading you down tutorial lane towards the first boss, with most optional quests (if not all) being locked! And nothing is more frustrating than spotting a new secret or puzzle and then being forced to turn around mere moments before you reach it. Now, on to that BOTW inspiration. In most places it's quite well executed, flying around with the glider, freezing water with ice characters to make paths, thawing frozen flowers with fire and cooling burning flowers off with ice so you can pick them up, but there's some points where they missed why BOTW did a thing, and put it in without thinking. The map is revealed through statues instead of towers, the towers in BOTW not just being there for revealing parts of the map, but as a lookout point, to help you explore, without putting markers on your map like most games. Lastly, the story. It's pretty alright. Nothing revolutionary, but has its moments. Pretty good dialogue, but in some cases, at least if you pick the female character it seems they've put in the wrong takes for some dialogue, subtitles not matching the dialogue and during some cutscenes you hear your brother being called your sister, and I encountered one case where two characters said the same line, one after the other.

"So far so good. Currently AR26 and I can literally go to any part of the map and have something to do. The only bad side of this game is I can't run it on 60fps, of balanced settings. I'm using an s8 and my brother is using a nova 5t. Also been seing a lot abt resin running out too quickly but haven't experienced that yet.

"Wouldn't let me edit my preexisting review, so had to make a new version, but I have to say the game's improved tremendously.

"Honestly really good game like really good. But for me too many things started coming up in terms of things we could do. I personally prefer the focus more on the story line rather than side quests and other tasks, and for me it can become a bit much. Otherwise wonderful game.

"[Music: 5/5] Hiring orchestras across the globe to perform masterpieces really does reflect how ambitious they were for this game. Yu Peng Cheng is a genius. If you're in it for the music, you won't be disappointed. [Graphics: 5/5] The graphics are just as advertised in the ads and the overworld is beautiful, and is not too graphics-intensive despite being an AAA-title. [Characters: 4/5] Great design and aesthetics, you'll always find a character you love in this game. Lore behind characters are top-tier. Gameplay is interesting and unique, but is a hit-or-miss for balancing and team synergy. Silver-lining is that you can always build the characters you enjoy, regardless. [Lore: 5/5] The main storyline is good, but the jewel lies in the side quests and hidden lore that you can find through exploration. If digging up mysteries is your thing, this game is going to be worthwhile for you. [Community: 4/5] People tend to be friendly and happy to help out. Toxic players are few and far between. Bottom line is that it is a casual-friendly game, but maybe not wallet-friendly.
