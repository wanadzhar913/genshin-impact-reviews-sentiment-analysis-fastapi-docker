"Definitely one of the games I played for a long time! However the more you play the game, the more you realize how the game's content is actually not that many. Some might argue that this is false because there's so many nations/locations; before I would've agreed but after playing this game for more than a year, I disagree. My reasoning for it is because exploring Teyvat isn't that hard. Teyvat is very easy to explore + the map is also really easy to understand which makes exploring really easy. Other than that, the characters are all designed well. Reward system is very flawed in my opinion, it takes a long time to actually get Primogems (Game Currency) once you're an end game player which would sometimes brainwash you into pretty much acting as if the Daily Commission is a chore.

This game is super fun in the beginning but once you get to AR 40 everything starts getting repetitive. The same kind of events happen every month (boring combat events). It's hard for f2p players that have higher ARs to farm primos because of how little rewards there are. The quests are boring and most of it doesn't give good rewards. This game is meant to be payed for. Farming is so difficult which makes it hard to get good builds.

The game is sometimes laggy but it is manageable. On older devices it probably might not work but it is a must play game.

Enhancing gear just feels like an annoying obstacle that you have to get through just so you can keep progressing. And, perhaps the most irritating thing is how clunky the transitions from activity such as swimming, climbing, etc. are to going back to walking/combat, especially during timed challenges. In fact, it's almost like the climbing time challenges are showcasing how terrible the game is at guessing when the player wants to climb up and when the player doesn't want to climb up. It's irritating during normal exploration as well since you'll randomly climb up trees for no reason. Not to mention, gacha rates are abysmal.

Don't go into this game expecting a small story, and a focus on the gacha aspect. Go into this game expecting a game full of amazing lore and charecter/world building, good maps, and a very long-term game.

This game is really good designed. The graphics are very good even in the lowest settings. BUT... two rings are REALLY annoying: You can't skip the dialogues (the are very long) and in every 3rd mission you have to travel all along the map for example from Monstadt to Lyuie (cities). The first one is in the northern of the map and the second one is in the southern west of the map. because of that I'm rating 3 Stars. And after your Adventure Rank 30 or 40 the game isn't interesting anymore.,designed graphics lowest settings two rings annoying skip dialogues long every rd mission travel along map example monstadt lyuie cities first one northern map second one southern west map rating stars adventure rank interesting anymore,3,1

Things i dont like as of now is that the game will restart if you minimize it for 2 seconds to quickly view another app. Why is this a thing?

I love Aether but Kaeya and Amber are kind of annoying which causes some issues when you have no other characters of that element and need that element for a puzzle.,style wonderful favorites pretty lucky gotten glad gacha games anything wish starter able aether kaeya amber kind annoying causes issues element element puzzle,5,0

Natlan characters. Their skin tones and their palettes absolutely do not match. They look horrible because the outfits and gear were obviously set to match with darker tones.

"Many things about this game are great. Examples are the graphics, gameplay, and most of the lore. The biggest issue is that with the representation of characters within certain regions, dosen't feel like they were designed the way they were supposed to. (For those who get it, get it.)

"Good basic game idea. Terrible execution. Enemies can juggle, stun lock, and basically destroy you at any level if they choose. Dodging works sometimes if you're exact on the timing. Also a lot of the game is about choosing the right elements for a battle. You can't do that with a lot of battles because enemies appear around you and you have no time to alter your team.

Though there are some issues regarding on the aiming system where it just stops moving when aiming on something... or some story CG that just kinda stops on one image while the audio keeps lagging... or the game itself keeps lagging that it starts becoming annoying.

Genshin is a very good open world game and i really love it. The Story is nice the Character's are Unique and all and all a pretty good game. It requires a lot of storage but the content it gives makes up fot it. The game also requires a slightly strong device to play so you just have to adjust the settings.

So thus game is a complete scam.

"Some design choices are frustrating and break immersion. For example, being asked to talk to the same character I'm currently controlling, like Amber is going to talk to Amber, feels very illogical.

No native controller input in a 3rd person action game?! It's right there on the PS4 version already. Why is it missing on mobile? If not for cross play with PC I would have rated lower.

This game can be entirely free to play. The game suffers from poor gambling mechanics. Each 10 draw has a 4* guaranteed but you can completely draw useless weapons or characters.

"|| POSITIVES || TEYVAT is a beautiful world, with breathtaking vistas and secrets to be discovered, full of hidden lore. The different countries are distinct and offer some variety of enemies. THE SOUNDTRACK is, hands down, one of the best in gaming history. From epic orchestral arrangements to electric guitar to soft piano melodies, it has it all and they're incredibly well mixed together. PLAYABLE CHARACTERS are very aesthetically pleasing, well voice acted and unique. THE MAIN STORY has some slow moments but overall I think it's good and has some EPIC battles scattered about. COMBAT in this game is great, imo. It's fluid, flashy and satisfying. Newer characters have overall better and more diverse animations than the older ones, but that's to be expected. THE HOUSING SYSTEM is a good sandbox addition to the game, though I can see how it's not for everyone. It's been updated fairly regularly since its release, with a big update coming in 2.2. GAME UPDATES every 6 weeks (on the dot!) with new events, and most times adds new characters or areas to explore. || NEGATIVES || It's a GACHA. And one with TERRIBLE rates. If you plan to go free to play don't expect to have most 5-stars in the game. On the other hand, 4-star characters are VERY good (for the most part) and nothing in this game requires you to have the best 5-star characters. THE WEAPON BANNER is a complete travesty, so only pull on it if you're a whale or if you like both featured weapons. THE ""ENDGAME"" is very grindy and repetitive, resin (energy) is scarce and if you're done with events you'll finish up your daily stuffs in about 15-20 minutes. BUGS and flawed mechanics/characters that have not been fixed since release. I rarely play on my phone, but every time I tried it's been a miserable experience. Do yourself a favor and try to play on PC, even a laptop with a integrated GPU does a better job running this game than my flagship smartphone. Also, the controls on mobile are terrible in my opinion. But hey, if you're used to it and you have a gaming smartphone I guess you can judge for yourself. || RECENT CONTROVERSIES || This game has been review bombed twice now, and it's for a simple reason: Mihoyo's communication with the player base is ATROCIOUS. They refuse to address glaring issues with the game, two of the last four 5-star characters have been released with broken mechanics or simply in a bad state, the anniversary rewards were, in my opinion, strangely bad for such a huge game and, to all these problems, their answer has been the same for the last 4 months: silence. This latest outrage was merely the culmination of all the frustrations players had for months. || TL;DR || Game good.

I was just disappointed on the rewards and also the resin issue where it is to small and the drops you get is smaller which is not worth it. In terms of artifacts you need to spend many resin until we can get the artifacts we needed.

And also increase the primogems reward on every long quest and only primo is 40üò°,disappointed rewards also resin issue small drops get smaller worth terms artifacts spend many resin get artifacts needed wanted remove limit condensed resin every convert resin condense resin everytime log use condensed resin day also increase primogems reward every long quest primo,4,0

"As great as Genshin Impact is for a Free-to-Play game with huge amount of fun and interesting events and contents always being added in each update, it has its own flaws that can't be overlooked unless you're worshiper of Mihoyo. In terms of graphics and worldbuilding of the game, it's a high quality product that works well even in mobile platform, especially considering the fact it's very large and eats a lot of storage and yet looks very beautiful. Its gameplay isn't too complexed to understand, yet enough for players and theory-crafters to come up with all kinds of different teams and match-up, and story that's praised by many fans of the game. Yet, it's fundamentally flaw as a game itself. In order for players to gain progress, it is outrageously slow because the resin, or stamina, charges up at an extremely slow rate, and the layers of RNG for artifacts (items to boost characters' stats) is ridiculous most of the times. To put into perspective, it can take several weeks or even months to get a worthwhile artifacts, and can be very tedious and grindy, making players like me feel burn out playing it. This artificial obstacle to keep players engaged to the game makes the game to become stale and uninteresting until the change comes. The lack of endgame contents also mean players don't have anything to spend their time to be entertained besides grinding same dungeon over and over again. Some may argue the wishing system or the gacha itself is predatory, but I believe it's at the right spot because it forces you to plan ahead of who you wish to get. Don't expect to get anyone if you don't bother to support the game, and the game itself isn't pay to win anyway, so there's no real competition among others. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this game for anyone who's interested in the characters, stories, and exploring areas never seen before.",impact free huge amount interesting events contents always added update flaws overlooked unless worshiper mihoyo terms graphics worldbuilding high quality product works well mobile platform especially considering fact large eats storage yet looks beautiful gameplay complexed understand yet enough players theory crafters come kinds different teams match praised many fans yet fundamentally flaw order players gain progress outrageously slow resin stamina charges extremely slow rate layers rng artifacts items boost stats ridiculous times put perspective several weeks months get worthwhile artifacts tedious grindy making players burn artificial obstacle keep players engaged makes become stale uninteresting change comes lack endgame contents also mean players anything spend time entertained besides grinding dungeon may argue wishing system gacha predatory believe right spot forces plan ahead wish get expect get anyone bother support pay win anyway real competition among others nevertheless highly recommend anyone interested stories exploring areas never seen,3,1

The story and music is good. But in terms of artifact farming? Waste of time. I've been playing for almost 3 years now and I barely got a good set. Games should not be this frustrating to equip your character with good stats. I hate to compare it with other gacha game but Genshin is by far the worst game regarding farming equipment for your character. Why not make it even by increasing resin cap or the time you're going to use resin is when you see a good artifact. Its like cashing out the item.,music terms artifact farming waste time almost years barely got set games frustrating equip stats hate compare gacha far worst regarding farming equipment increasing resin cap time going use resin see artifact cashing item,2,1

"5.0 Update: GI offers an incredible open-world, and the recent story has been strong as well. The dailies system has been improved to reward engagement with quests, while also making it easier to use resin and get rewarded.

This is a great game and I really enjoy the many challenges that it offers as well as the character designs but I don't really like the fact that none of the characters are accurately portraying the cultures and religions that they are inspired by properly. The skin tones are off by a lot and the names aren't very accurate either. I don't think it's fair to use someone's background and not give the appropriate attention and detail to those as much as the first few nations that were shown,enjoy many challenges offers well designs fact none accurately portraying cultures religions inspired properly skin tones names accurate either think fair use someone background give appropriate attention detail first nations shown,1,1

"Genshin Impact has surprised me. I'm very critical of mobile games and the business practices associated with them, and while Genshin Impact isn't perfect, it's the best mobile game I've seen by far. When I initially saw Genshin Impact, my major concerns were: Business model, paywalls, overall gameplay and how they handled the quite obvious inspiration from The Legends of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Starting off with the business model. It's a gacha game, which is already a fair bit of a negative, I will never not speak out about psuedo-gambling mechanics and business models as they're inherently exploitative. Genshin's business model is... Okay for a gacha game. my biggest problem with it is that there are weapons in the gacha, where most players would prefer more of a focus of characters, putting weapons in feels like filler, and there are weapons only available from the gachas, separate from those which drop throughout the world. Now, onto paywalls. I've completed the story by now, and have not encountered any real paywalls. All progression is tied to ingame activities. Some materials however are in dungeons where you need a regenerating resource to open the final chest, and this resource has a rather low upper roof, and doesn't regenerate very quickly. The maximum amount being 120, refilling from 0 in 16 hours and I've encountered chests that cost 60 to open and this resource, can be refilled with premium currency. And then there's the gameplay, where this game actually shines! The game is a 3D action RPG, with a gorgeous artstyle that, while clearly inspired by Breath of the Wild is visually unique. Combat is fluid and fast, with every character having a weapon type and two abilities belonging to an element, and the combat system is a pretty good hack and slash affair at its base, with a dodge move to support it. Beyond the weapon combat there is an element combination system, where you swap between characters mid-fight and use the environment for new effects, in the rain, ice characters will freeze them solid, and electric attacks will cause them to chain lightning between each other, you can set fire to them and then electrocute them triggering an explosion and more! The game setting is a huge open world with plenty of secrets, collectibles and challenges all over the place, it's quite busy! My one BIG complaint here is that the game limits where you can explore pretty harshly right at the start, tying you down to a small part of the first area. What makes this extra puzzling is that the world is very obviously set up to be explored, just like Breath of the Wild, but unlike BOTW which opens up to a larger world very quickly, and tutorialises by showing instead of telling. Genshin Impact starts by pretty much railroading you down tutorial lane towards the first boss, with most optional quests (if not all) being locked! And nothing is more frustrating than spotting a new secret or puzzle and then being forced to turn around mere moments before you reach it. Now, on to that BOTW inspiration. In most places it's quite well executed, flying around with the glider, freezing water with ice characters to make paths, thawing frozen flowers with fire and cooling burning flowers off with ice so you can pick them up, but there's some points where they missed why BOTW did a thing, and put it in without thinking. The map is revealed through statues instead of towers, the towers in BOTW not just being there for revealing parts of the map, but as a lookout point, to help you explore, without putting markers on your map like most games. Lastly, the story. It's pretty alright. Nothing revolutionary, but has its moments. Pretty good dialogue, but in some cases, at least if you pick the female character it seems they've put in the wrong takes for some dialogue, subtitles not matching the dialogue and during some cutscenes you hear your brother being called your sister, and I encountered one case where two characters said the same line, one after the other. Oh and no controller support, which I feel is urgently needed.",impact surprised critical mobile games business practices associated impact perfect best mobile seen far initially saw impact major concerns business model paywalls overall gameplay handled quite obvious inspiration legends zelda breath wild starting business model gacha already fair bit negative never speak psuedo gambling mechanics business models inherently exploitative business model okay gacha biggest problem weapons gacha players would prefer focus putting weapons feels filler weapons available gachas separate drop throughout world onto paywalls completed encountered real paywalls progression tied ingame activities materials however dungeons regenerating resource open final chest resource rather low upper roof regenerate quickly maximum amount refilling hours encountered chests cost open resource refilled premium currency gameplay actually shines action rpg gorgeous artstyle clearly inspired breath wild visually unique combat fluid fast every weapon type two abilities belonging element combat system pretty hack slash affair base dodge move support beyond weapon combat element combination system swap mid fight use environment new effects rain ice freeze solid electric attacks cause chain lightning set fire electrocute triggering explosion setting huge open world plenty secrets collectibles challenges place quite busy one big complaint limits explore pretty harshly right start tying small part first area makes extra puzzling world obviously set explored breath wild unlike botw opens larger world quickly tutorialises showing instead telling impact starts pretty railroading tutorial lane towards first boss optional quests locked nothing frustrating spotting new secret puzzle forced turn around mere moments reach botw inspiration places quite well executed flying around glider freezing water ice paths thawing frozen flowers fire cooling burning flowers ice pick points missed botw thing put without thinking map revealed statues instead towers towers botw revealing parts map lookout point help explore without putting markers map games lastly pretty alright nothing revolutionary moments pretty dialogue cases least pick female seems put wrong takes dialogue subtitles matching dialogue cutscenes hear brother called sister encountered one case two said line one oh controller support urgently needed,4,0

"Developers haven't made any effort to compensate players or adjust the temporary rewards for completing the recent story chapters.

"It's fine. I like the story and the characters but it's easy to get burnt out from this game. The BP and welkin make little difference. Resource scarcity makes me have to grind more, with no way of making it easier. Domains are horrible, and I can never roll into any good artefacts. The rates are just bad all around. I'd get 5 star characters I don't want and then I end up spending upwards of $150 to get a character I DO want. Please don't be dumb like me and spend money on this game.",fine easy get burnt bp welkin little difference resource scarcity makes grind way making easier domains horrible never roll artefacts rates bad around get star end spending upwards get please dumb spend money,3,1

"Story is good, open world exploration mechanics also good, combat system is good. I wish this wasnt a gatcha game but excluding weapon banner, the gatcha system aint that bad. However, the difficulty of the game needs to be upped.

"[Music: 5/5] Hiring orchestras across the globe to perform masterpieces really does reflect how ambitious they were for this game. Yu Peng Cheng is a genius. If you're in it for the music, you won't be disappointed. [Graphics: 5/5] The graphics are just as advertised in the ads and the overworld is beautiful, and is not too graphics-intensive despite being an AAA-title. [Characters: 4/5] Great design and aesthetics, you'll always find a character you love in this game. Lore behind characters are top-tier. Gameplay is interesting and unique, but is a hit-or-miss for balancing and team synergy. Silver-lining is that you can always build the characters you enjoy, regardless. [Lore: 5/5] The main storyline is good, but the jewel lies in the side quests and hidden lore that you can find through exploration. If digging up mysteries is your thing, this game is going to be worthwhile for you. [Community: 4/5] People tend to be friendly and happy to help out. Toxic players are few and far between. Bottom line is that it is a casual-friendly game, but maybe not wallet-friendly.
